    "team_consensus": "The chosen stack offers a robust solution for building the task API, with an emphasis on scalability, security, performance, and ease of integration. Node.js with Express.js provides efficient server-side scripting, React.js offers reusable UI components and seamless API integration, PostgreSQL stores complex data efficiently, Docker containers are lightweight and portable, and Kubernetes automates deployment and management."

    "data_flow": "Users authenticate and send requests to the API, which interacts with the PostgreSQL database to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The React frontend receives responses from the API and displays them to users.",
    "scalability_approach": "As this is a simple project, scalability can be managed by using connection pooling in Express.js, optimizing database queries, implementing caching, and using a CDN for static assets as needed.",
    "security_architecture": "Implement HTTPS, secure Passport.js strategies for authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and proper handling of sensitive data such as passwords.",
    "deployment_strategy": "Dockerize the application and use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for deployment in production environments with load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.",
    "complexity_justification": "The chosen architecture is appropriate because it meets the project requirements while being efficient and scalable. The technology stack provides a strong foundation for building and maintaining the simple task API with user authentication and CRUD operations."
