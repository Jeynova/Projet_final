    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Popular, efficient, and flexible for building web applications, especially APIs. Offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for handling user authentication, data validation, and more. The non-blocking nature of Node.js makes it ideal for scalability."
    },
    "frontend": {
      "name": "React.js with Next.js",
      "reasoning": "Efficient and performance-focused JavaScript library for building modern web applications. Next.js provides features such as automatic code splitting, server-side rendering (SSR) for improved loading times, and the ability to generate static websites for better SEO, contributing to a user-friendly frontend experience."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "MongoDB Atlas",
      "reasoning": "Flexible data model with JSON-like documents, making it ideal for CRUD operations in a task management application. It also provides scalability, high availability, and security features out of the box."
    },
    "deployment": {
      "name": "Heroku",
      "reasoning": "Simplifies application deployment, maintenance, and scaling. Supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, and offers a free tier for development purposes."
