  "project_name": "TaskManager",
  "prompt": "Create a complete task management platform with:\n- User authentication (register, login, JWT)\n- Task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)\n- Task categories and priorities\n- Due date management and notifications\n- Team collaboration features\n- Dashboard with analytics\n- REST API with proper error handling\n- Responsive frontend with modern UI\n- Database schema with relationships",
  "tech_stack": {
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js (Express.js) with TypeScript",
      "reasoning": "Chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture which can handle high concurrency and scalability requirements. TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript, enhancing code maintainability and reducing errors. Express.js provides a minimalist web framework for building APIs."
    },
    "frontend": {
      "name": "React.js with Typescript and Material-UI",
      "reasoning": "Chosen for its component-based architecture that allows for easy scalability and maintains the separation of concerns. Typescript ensures type safety, while Material-UI provides pre-designed UI components to create a modern and responsive frontend quickly."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM",
      "reasoning": "Chosen for its robustness, ACID compliance, scalability. PostgreSQL is a popular, open-source, object-relational database management system. Prisma ORM simplifies database operations, reduces boilerplate code, and supports multiple databases. It also generates TypeScript definitions to ensure type safety."
    },
    "deployment": {
      "name": "Docker for containers, Kubernetes for orchestration, AWS ECS/EC2 for deployment",
      "reasoning": "Docker allows consistent development, testing, and production environments across different stages. Kubernetes simplifies container orchestration and scaling of applications, making it ideal for managing deployments in a dynamic environment like AWS EKS. AWS ECS/EC2 provides reliable, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure to deploy and manage the containerized application."
    },

Teams collaborate on tasks through the dashboard. The API handles data requests and returns responses with proper error handling.",
    "scalability_approach": "Implement load balancing using reverse proxies like NGINX or HAProxy. Use database partitioning and sharding to manage growing data volumes. Cache frequently accessed data for performance optimization.",
    "security_architecture": "Use JWT for token-based authentication. Implement rate limiting, CSRF protection, secure cookies, and input validation. Follow OWASP security best practices.",
    "deployment_strategy": "Use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for production deployment. Set up multiple environments (development, staging, production) with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).",
    "complexity_justification": "The task management platform requires moderately complex data models, user interactions, and collaboration features. The chosen technology stack provides a balance between simplicity for faster development and scalability for growth."
