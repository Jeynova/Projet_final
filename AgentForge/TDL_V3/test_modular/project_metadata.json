    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "The consensus among the team is that Node.js with Express.js is a robust, efficient, and popular choice for building APIs. It offers a lightweight, non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling asynchronous operations and user authentication."
    },
    "frontend": {
      "name": "React.js",
      "reasoning": "The team agrees that React.js is the best choice for building complex UIs due to its declarative approach and component-based architecture, which simplifies state management and data fetching."
    },
    "database": {
      "name": "MongoDB",
      "reasoning": "A consensus has been reached that MongoDB is ideal for this project because it offers flexible JSON-like documents, scalability, and strong community support, making it suitable for handling CRUD operations."
    },
    "deployment": {
      "name": "Heroku",
      "reasoning": "Heroku has been chosen due to its ease of use, scalability, and built-in support for various services like Postgres, Redis, and CI/CD. It allows easy deployment of applications built with different languages."
    },
    "team_consensus": "The team agrees that the proposed stack of Node.js with Express.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Heroku for deployment will provide a secure, efficient, scalable, and maintainable solution for the task API with user authentication and CRUD operations."

    "scalability_approach": "As this project is simple, scalability is not a primary concern for the initial implementation. However, consider using cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud for horizontal scaling as the user base grows.",
    "security_architecture": "Implement JWT-based authentication with salted and hashed password storage, and follow best practices such as input validation, sanitization, and secure cookies.",
    "deployment_strategy": "Dockerize the application to simplify deployment and scaling using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Use environment variables for configuration management and deploy to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.",
    "complexity_justification": "Given the simple project scope, this architecture focuses on providing a secure, scalable, and maintainable solution while keeping complexity to a minimum."
