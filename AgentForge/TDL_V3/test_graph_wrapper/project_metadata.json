  "tech_stack": {
    "backend": {
      "name": "Node.js with Express.js",
      "reasoning": "Provides a robust framework for building REST APIs, supports middleware for authentication, and has a large ecosystem of libraries to aid in task management and security."
    },
    "frontend": {
      "name": "React.js",
      "reasoning": "Popular choice due to its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to maintain and extend, and its ability to deliver fast and interactive user interfaces."

      "name": "MongoDB",
      "reasoning": "Offers a flexible data model that can handle various types of data easily. It also provides built-in support for real-time data updates, which can be beneficial for applications requiring quick response times."

      "name": "Heroku (for ease of deployment)",
      "reasoning": "Easy-to-use platform offering seamless deployment of web applications built with Node.js and other popular frameworks, providing a free tier for small projects and scalable solutions as the project grows."
    },
    "team_consensus": "The chosen stack ensures secure user authentication, creates a scalable and performant API, provides a user-friendly frontend interface, and deploys the application quickly and efficiently."

      "CI/CD scripts to automate testing and deployment processes."
    ],
    "data_flow": "Users authenticate through the API and interact with their tasks. The backend communicates with MongoDB to persist and retrieve task data. Real-time updates are possible due to MongoDB's built-in support for real-time data updates.",
    "scalability_approach": "Horizontal scaling can be achieved by adding more containers or nodes as needed, while database scalability can be achieved using sharding or replication.",
    "security_architecture": "HTTPS is used for secure communication between clients and the API. JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization. Additional security measures such as rate limiting, input validation, and sanitization are implemented to prevent attacks.",
    "deployment_strategy": "The application will be containerized using Docker and deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) using Kubernetes for easy scaling and management.",
    "complexity_justification": "Given the project's simplicity, this architecture balances keeping the system easy to maintain while still providing essential features like user authentication and task management. The chosen technology stack offers a good balance between ease of development, scalability, and performance."
